Python cheat note

Chapter 2

Variable is a container in Python
 A - is a variable in python this is the process of declaration of python
“Ayon” - when we mark as string in python that means it only indicate particular that name
This “Ayon” is identifier in the here, if we declare it with variable , then we call it also identifier
Data type is :
1. Numeric data types: int, float, complex.
2. String data types: str.
3. Sequence types: list, tuple, range.
4. Binary types: bytes, bytearray, memoryview.
5. Mapping data type: dict.
6. Boolean type: bool.
7. Set data types: set, frozenset.

Chapter 3(string)
If we eclair any string then we can not change it , we need re-declare it
Give the particular string
name = "Ayonbhai"


nameshort = name[0:3] #which actualy give you Ayo
 
print(nameshort)

3. b = "124567890"


bf = b[1:4:3]
print(bf)

This is a split or jump of string , like , starting with 2 (0=1 and 1=2…), then go to 
6 (which indicates 3), 4 means you can only jump 4 and not much more and when it jumps it reaches 6 which is actually the last value and you cannot take that.
